          Once upon a time there was a billionaire. This guy had reached the
          true elite; he’d achieved epic results in both his professional and
          personal spheres. He became the kind of person you can’t help but
          admire. Someone who you knew would leave a positive legacy for the
          world.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what was his secret? Did he have a natural talent that helped him
          succeed? Nope – it wasn’t natural talent. Were his accomplishments the
          result of hard work and grit. No, not that either.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you may have gathered form the title of these blinks, this
          billionaire attributed all his success to a simple, yet revolutionary
          morning routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every day, our billionaire would rise at 5:00 a.m. And after waking,
          he’d follow a little known formula designed to turbocharge his mental
          focus, build his physical fitness and encourage him to be his best
          self day in and day out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would you like to know this morning routine? It's time to take you
          through the main ideas of Robin Sharma’s The 5 AM Club.&nbsp;

          In these blinks, we’ll follow the fictitious tale of a curious group
          of people: A depressed entrepreneur, in need of revitalization; a
          frustrated artist, trying to refuel his creativity and develop a
          legacy; and a billionaire with a string of successes behind him and a
          desire to pass on the knowledge of how to live an extraordinary life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three met at a personal optimization conference addressed by a
          legendary business guru, the Spellbinder, someone renowned for his
          ability to weave magic and captivate his audience with the power of
          his insights. The billionaire approached the entrepreneur and the
          artist after the Spellbinder’s speech had finished but they didn’t
          know that he was a billionaire. The billionaire was disguised as a
          poor man, a habit he had developed to remind himself that money isn’t
          everything. The only clue to his actual wealth was his expensive
          watch. The impoverished-looking billionaire told the two that he’d
          made a fortune thanks to the Spellbinder, who’d taught him that while
          many people wish that extraordinary things will happen to them, truly
          elite performers learn that they can make extraordinary things happen
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entrepreneur and the artist became more and more curious about
          this mysterious man who talked like he was a guru himself. They
          listened as the billionaire explained how the Spellbinder –&nbsp;who,
          in fact, was the billionaire’s personal mentor –&nbsp;had taught him
          one thing that was more important than anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was it? That the most reliable way to generate the best results
          in your personal and professional life is to build a world-beating
          morning routine. Being a generous man, the billionaire made an
          incredible offer. If the entrepreneur and artist wanted to come hang
          with him at his beach house in Mauritius, he would teach them the
          secrets of a world-class morning routine. All they needed to do was
          meet the next morning at 5:00 a.m.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entrepreneur and the artist were a little skeptical the next
          morning, but it started to soften when a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce
          collected them and delivered them to a hangar containing a sleek,
          ivory-colored private jet, which bore the logo: “5AC.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The entrepreneur asked the chauffeur what the logo meant, and he
          explained that it stood for “The 5 AM Club.” And so began their
          journey toward understanding a revolutionary morning routine and a
          whole new outlook on life with the potential to transform everything
          for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early the next morning, the billionaire told the entrepreneur and
          artist how getting up at 5:00 a.m. was the way he had learned to
          escape mediocrity and achieve greatness. Getting up at 5:00 a.m. had
          promoted his creativity, doubled his energy, and tripled his
          productivity. How?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the billionaire told them, many true greats throughout history,
          from novelist John Grisham to composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, have
          understood that the isolation that comes from getting up at 5:00 a.m.
          has a multiplying effect.

          All of us have limited mental capacity or <em>cognitive bandwidth</em>
          . And throughout the day, our attention is given to more and more
          things: work, the news, interaction with others and social media. Our
          bandwidth gets used up by all of these so, by lunchtime, we can’t
          really concentrate on anything at all. By constantly shifting our
          focus from one thing to another, we give nothing enough attention. But
          if you get up at 5:00 a.m., you have a golden opportunity to focus on
          one high-value activity without your brain getting distracted.
        </p>
        <p>
          This focus is further enhanced by the concept of
          <em> transient hypofrontality</em>, which means, in a nutshell, that
          at 5:00 a.m., you are well placed to achieve a state of <em>flow</em>{" "}
          in your thinking.

          On a dazzling morning in Mauritius, the entrepreneur, the artist, and
          the billionaire gathered by the sea. A school of squirrelfish swam
          through the crystal clear waters. In this beautiful setting, the
          billionaire recounted the four focuses of the great historymakers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, he said, the greatest people are defined not by their natural
          talent, but by the extent to which they <em>capitalize</em>. According
          to the billionaire, self-discipline and perseverance always trump
          talent and giftedness. So rather than thinking you don’t have what it
          takes, capitalize on the gifts you’ve got to make a difference.

            How often, asked the billionaire, have you heard a guru talk about
            improving your mindset? We hear it all the time – think optimistic
            thoughts, and you’ll improve your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, said the billionaire, strolling along a white sand beach with
            his pupils, what these gurus don’t tell you is that your{" "}
            <em>Mindset</em> is just one of four “interior empires.” If you’re
            only working on your Mindset, you’re ignoring your{" "}
            <em>Healthset</em>, your <em>Heartset</em>, and your{" "}
            <em>Soulset</em>. That’s like only polishing 25 percent of a
            picture!
